                <p>Room type definitions are complex and go well beyond whether the sleeping area has a single bed or queen-size, or whether it's a smoking room or not.</p>
        
        <p> room type distinctions can be confusing for guests who are just seeking to understand what, exactly, it is for which they are paying. This guide seeks to help guests understand what the different types of hotel rooms are, 
            as well as build justification for pricing your property's rooms on a certain scale.</p>
            <center><p><b>Room Types by Occupancy</b></p></center>
                <p>It’s common for hotels to list their rooms based on how many people the room is equipped to handle. </p>
                    <p> Here’s what you can expect when you see rooms labeled in this way.</p>
                
                <P><b>Single room:</b> these rooms are assigned to one person or a couple. It may have one or more beds, but the size of the bed depends on the hotel.</p>
                 Some single rooms have a twin bed, most will have a double, few will have a queen bed.
                
                <P><b>Double room:</b> double rooms are assigned to two people; expect one double bed, or two twin beds depending on the hotel.</p>
                
                <p><b>Triple room:</b> as the name might suggest, this room is equipped for three people to stay. The room will have a combination of either three twin beds, one double bed and a twin, or two double beds.</p>
                
               <p><b>Quad room:</b> a quad room is set up for four people to stay comfortably. This means the room will have two double beds. Some, however, may be set up dormitory-style with bunks or twins, so check with the property to make sure.</p>
